# DocumentManagementAPI
 
PdfDocument Service .NET Core Web Api

Added Swagger Configuration

Added unit tests with nUnit

Note:

I have not used any data storage as has to spend 1 hour approx but used file system as a data storage for now.
It can easily be integrated to any data storage like sql, Azure blob storage etc so for that have to create data storage first and create Data Repository to integrate with database

I wanted to implement as a generic controller which can take PDFDocument type class to do all actions, by doing this This Generic service can be used for other types File upload service. Because of time constraint couldnt implement this but would like to improve like mentioned.


Thanks for looking my quick solution for PDFDocument Service.
